            I am a retired firefighter but have transitioned to web development to supplement my retirement income.
            I have worked on applications and microservices deployed on Microsoft Azure as well as AWS. 
            I am an avid user of ChatGPT, and find it an extremely useful tool for simplifying my work while coding.

          into a reality. I would definitely recommend him to anyone looking for a web developer.

          Hot Sites went above and beyond to meet my expectations on my new website. 
          They were always available to answer my questions, and they were always willing to make changes until

          to detail. The website looks great, and it's exactly what I was looking for.
